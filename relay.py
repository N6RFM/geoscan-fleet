Persistent KISS relay.

Runs forever (independent of any satellite pass). For each satellite it
opens two listening TCP ports:

  - producer_port: the currently-running per-satellite .grc connects INTO
    this as a TCP client (blocks_socket_pdu, TCP_CLIENT) and pushes KISS
    frame bytes.
  - consumer_port: your downstream decoder/dashboard connects INTO this
    (same port it already expects) and receives whatever the relay
    forwards. This socket never closes just because a pass ends - only
    the producer side comes and goes.

Run this once, alongside run_passes.py, before any pass starts.

Keep-alive strategy (added after one of four parallel consumer
connections kept silently dropping, requiring manual reconnection):

  1. TCP-level keepalive (SO_KEEPALIVE + tuned intervals on Linux) on
     every accepted socket - catches a genuinely dead connection (or a
     NAT/firewall silently killing an idle one) much faster than the
     OS default, which can take hours. This sends no application-level
     bytes at all, so it cannot confuse any KISS parser.

  NOTE: an earlier version of this file also sent a periodic empty KISS
  frame (FEND FEND) as an application-level heartbeat. That was removed
  after tracing SatsDecoder's own kiss_read_stream()/​_receive() code:
  an empty/malformed KISS frame is indistinguishable from a genuine
  disconnect in that client (both produce a falsy `frame`, triggering
  its "Connection lost" path) - so the heartbeat was actively causing
  the disconnects it was meant to prevent. TCP keepalive alone is safe
  because it never touches the byte stream the KISS parser sees.
