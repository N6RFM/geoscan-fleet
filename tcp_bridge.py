tcp_bridge.py - the mirror-image of relay.py, for a satellite whose flowgraph
runs its own TCP_SERVER instead of connecting out as a TCP_CLIENT.

relay.py can only ever listen on both sides - every satellite that uses
it has a flowgraph that connects OUT to it as a client. Some flowgraphs
do the opposite: they run their own TCP_SERVER and wait for a specific
downstream app (an SSDV image viewer, say) to connect IN. That's fine
while the flowgraph is running, but the flowgraph is short-lived - it
only exists during a pass - so without something in between, the
downstream app has no stable endpoint to connect to between passes, and
has to detect the drop and reconnect at the start of every single one.

tcp_bridge.py solves that the same way relay.py solves it for the opposite
direction: it connects OUT to the flowgraph's TCP_SERVER as a client
(retrying patiently whenever the flowgraph isn't running - i.e. between
passes), while LISTENING persistently for the real downstream consumer.
The consumer gets one stable address to point at, for the life of a
session, exactly like a SatsDecoder tab does with relay.py.

Multiple satellites can share ONE bridge_port if they feed the same
downstream app (e.g. two satellites both feeding the same SSDV image
viewer) - each gets its own independent upstream connection, retrying on
its own, but they share a single real listening socket, so the
downstream app never has to change which port it's pointed at depending
on which satellite is actually passing. Since only one satellite's
flowgraph is ever actually running at a time (one shared SDR), only one
upstream connection is ever actually live in practice - the others just
sit retrying, harmlessly, until it's their turn.

One-directional only (flowgraph -> downstream consumer) - this is for a
data stream like SSDV frames, not a two-way control channel. Doesn't
parse or care what's inside the bytes, same as relay.py.

Configured per satellite via an extra_outputs entry with its own
dedicated protocol, tcp_bridge:

    extra_outputs:
      - name: ssdv_viewer
        protocol: tcp_bridge
        block: network_socket_pdu_0
        port: 9985          # THIS satellite's flowgraph TCP_SERVER -
                             # tcp_bridge.py connects out to it as a client
        bridge_port: 19985   # what the real downstream consumer (the
                             # SSDV Viewer app) should actually connect to -
                             # shared across every satellite that uses it

Disabled satellites (enabled: false) are skipped entirely, same as
relay.py.
