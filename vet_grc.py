"""
Vets a .grc file for the specific classes of bugs this project has
actually hit, repeatedly, from hand-editing in GRC - especially from
copy/pasting blocks, which GRC handles by silently appending _0, _0_0,
etc. to the new block's name to avoid a collision, rather than warning
you it happened.

By default, purely read-only. --fix applies ONLY the two issues that are
a pure rename with no structural change at all - a block's name, or the
flowgraph's own options.id - never anything that requires deciding which
of two duplicate blocks to keep, or how to rewire a missing mechanism.
Those still need a human decision in GRC; --fix refuses to touch them.
Every fix shows a diff and is applied only after that, with a .bak of
the original written first.

Usage:
    python3 vet_grc.py flowgraphs/geoscan1.grc
    python3 vet_grc.py                          # vets every flowgraphs/*.grc
    python3 vet_grc.py --fix flowgraphs/asrtussdv.grc
