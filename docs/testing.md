# groundtrack: Testing

[← back to README](../README.md)

## The full end-to-end test recipe (no real pass, no test files required)

Everything below works with a freshly-set-up fleet - none of it requires a
satellite to have ever actually been received yet:

```
python3 doctor.py              # environment sanity: right folder? stray processes? free ports?
python3 preflight.py --live    # config correctness + each flowgraph launches without crashing
python3 relay.py &             # (or: nohup python3 relay.py > relay.log 2>&1 &)
python3 test_downstream.py     # pushes frames through the relay to your decoder(s)
```

If all four of those come back clean, every layer of the system - config,
flowgraph startup, relay connectivity, and decoder connectivity - has been
verified, and the only thing left untested is the live RF/SDR path itself,
which only a real pass (or `preflight.py --live`'s brief hardware launch)
touches.

## Sending test frames to your decoder (without waiting for a pass)

**`test_downstream.py` is the one to run — it works with zero setup, no test files required.** For every configured satellite it automatically checks whether a real captured `.kss` file exists yet; if so it replays real frames, and if not (the normal situation before a satellite's first real pass) it transparently falls back to synthetic frames instead. You never need to decide which mode to use or locate a file yourself:

```
python3 relay.py &
python3 test_downstream.py
```

That tests every satellite in `satellites.yaml` in one pass. To test just one:
```
python3 test_downstream.py --satellite GEOSCAN-1 --count 5
```

Point each satellite's decoder tab at its `consumer_port` (from `satellites.yaml`) before running this, and watch its history pane for new entries as frames arrive. Synthetic frames will very likely show up as CRC/parse errors in the decoder - that's expected, since the payload is garbage; what matters is that the frame *count* goes up at all, confirming the relay→decoder wire and KISS framing work correctly end to end.

Once a satellite has actually completed a real pass and has a non-empty `.kss` file on disk, `test_downstream.py` will automatically start using those real frames instead - no flag to remember, no path to look up.

**`send_test_frames.py` still exists underneath** for single-satellite, explicit control (e.g. forcing synthetic even if a real capture exists, or pointing at a specific file):
```
python3 send_test_frames.py --satellite GEOSCAN-2 --replay /home/YOUR_USERNAME/Desktop/GEOSCAN-2.kss --count 5
python3 send_test_frames.py --satellite GEOSCAN-2 --synthetic 5
```

## Verifying Doppler and rotor control are working

**From inside the script:** `python3 run_passes.py --verbose` prints a
line every second while a pass is active:
```
[GEOSCAN-2] el= 31.5 az=214.3  freq=436,158,412 Hz (doppler -1,588 Hz)
```
Nothing printing while a satellite should be up? Check `schedule.yaml` -
the pass may not be approved, or its window may not actually cover "now"
(stale schedule - rerun `plan_passes.py`).

**From outside the script**, independent of `run_passes.py` - useful to
confirm rigctld/rotctld are alive even with no pass active:
```
printf 'f\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 4532      # Doppler - current commanded freq
printf 'p\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 4533      # Rotor - current commanded az/el
```
or, with Hamlib's own clients:
```
rigctl -m 2 -r 127.0.0.1:4532 f
rotctl -m 2 -r 127.0.0.1:4533 p
```
Query twice a few seconds apart *during an active pass* - the numbers
should change each time; outside a pass they'll sit at whatever idle
value the daemon started with (rigctld's Dummy backend defaults to
145000000 Hz), which is expected, not broken.

Be careful testing the rotor manually with a real `P <az> <el>` command -
unlike rigctld's Dummy backend, `rotctld` is driving real hardware and
will actually move the antenna.

"Connection refused" on either port means that daemon isn't running or
isn't listening where `satellites.yaml` says - check with
`ps aux | grep rigctld` / `ps aux | grep rotctld`.

**No pass due for hours and want to test sooner?** Temporarily lower one
satellite's `min_elev_deg` in `satellites.yaml` (e.g. to `0`), rerun
`plan_passes.py --hours 2`, and you'll likely get a near-term low pass to
watch trigger end-to-end. Remember to put the threshold back afterward.
