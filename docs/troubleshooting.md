# groundtrack: Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

Symptoms we've actually hit, in the order worth checking:

**`Connection refused` from `test_downstream.py` or when connecting your
decoder to a consumer port**
`relay.py` isn't running (or died). Check with `ps aux | grep relay.py`,
or just run `python3 doctor.py` - it lists exactly what's holding each
fleet port, and if a port shows `free` when it should show `relay.py`,
that's your answer. Start it: `nohup python3 relay.py > relay.log 2>&1 &`

**Real passes happen with signal/frames visible in the console, but
nothing shows up in your downstream decoder**
Almost certainly: only one satellite's consumer port has a decoder
connected to it, and a different satellite's pass just happened. The
relay serves every relay-using satellite's consumer port simultaneously
and continuously - it never switches which port is "active." Your
decoder needs **one persistent connection per relay-using satellite, all
open at once** - not one connection you re-point before each pass. See [The relay](architecture.md) for the exact setup. Verify with `tail -f relay.log`:
you should see one `consumer connected` line per relay-using satellite
that persists,
not one connection that comes and goes.

**Frames arrive but your decoder can't parse them / shows garbage**
First check you're not just looking at *synthetic* test frames
(`test_downstream.py` sends these automatically when no real capture
exists yet - they're garbage payload by design, not a bug). If you
expected real captured data, double check your decoder's **Port** field
matches the satellite you think you're testing - `satellites.yaml` maps
each satellite to a specific `consumer_port` (8101=GEOSCAN-1,
8102=GEOSCAN-2, etc.), and pointing a "GEOSCAN-2" decoder tab at port 8101
will silently show you GEOSCAN-1's traffic instead, with no error at all.
This exact mixup happened once already in this setup - the tab was
labeled correctly but the port field wasn't updated to match.

**A pass looks completely normal in the console and in the `.kss` file,
but SatsDecoder shows one giant garbage frame (e.g. misparsed as
`INNOSAT16`, hundreds of bytes long) and then nothing further for the
rest of the pass**
This is the missing-KISS-framing bug, not a relay or SatsDecoder
problem - see "Why every `.grc` needs a `kiss_encode_pdu` block" above
for the full explanation. Confirm by checking whether that satellite's
`.grc` has `kiss_encode_pdu` between the decoder and `network_socket_pdu`;
if it's wired directly, that's the cause. Fix: add the block, `grcc` (or
`./regen_all.sh` for everything), and re-verify with the KISS File
Source -> `kiss_encode_pdu` -> Socket PDU test rig described in that
section before trusting the next live pass.

**`SatsDecoder` shows "Connection lost" mid-pass, decoder tab drops with
signal still visibly active**
This was a real bug in `SatsDecoder` itself, not this toolkit -
`kiss_read_stream()` returned the same falsy value (`b''`) for both "no
data yet" and "connection actually closed," so a perfectly ordinary empty
KISS frame could get misread as a dropped connection partway through a
pass. Fixed upstream in commit `d94ff8e` ("KISS reader refact"), first
available in the `nightly` tag - update with:
```
cd ~/SatsDecoder
git fetch --tags
git checkout nightly
```
(if you have a local `nightly` tag already cached from before this fix
landed, `git fetch --tags` won't move it - `git tag -d nightly` first,
then re-fetch, or you'll silently stay on the old code.)
`relay.py`'s TCP keepalive is a separate, complementary safeguard against
a genuinely stalled connection - it does not fix this specific bug, so
update `SatsDecoder` rather than relying on keepalive alone.

**Terminal looks "stuck" after backgrounding `relay.py`**
It isn't - `python3 relay.py &` sometimes prints its startup lines a
moment *after* bash already returned your prompt, which looks like a
hang but isn't one (press Enter and the prompt reappears clean). Avoid
the confusion entirely by redirecting its output instead of leaving it
attached to your terminal: `nohup python3 relay.py > relay.log 2>&1 &`,
then `tail -f relay.log` whenever you want to check on it.

**A port that should be free shows `IN USE` and you don't know why**
Run `python3 doctor.py` - it identifies the exact PID and command holding
every fleet port. This has caught real orphaned processes before (e.g. a
`rigctld` left running from a folder that had since been moved to Trash,
still holding port 4532 indefinitely). Kill the specific PID it reports,
or `pkill -f <name>` for a broader cleanup.

**Config edits don't seem to take effect**
`.grc` files are source; `run_passes.py` and `preflight.py` execute the
compiled `.py` next to them. Any edit to a `.grc` needs
`grcc flowgraphs/geoscanN.grc` before it does anything. `preflight.py`
flags this automatically ("`.py` is up to date with `.grc`").

**`network_socket_pdu` reverts to `TCP_SERVER` after editing/regenerating
a `.grc` in GNU Radio Companion**
This has happened more than once - something about re-adding or resolving
that block in GRC resets it to its default. There's no permanent fix on
our side for GRC's behavior, so make checking a habit:
`python3 preflight.py` explicitly checks this on every satellite and will
fail loudly if it's reverted, rather than you discovering it mid-pass.

**Multiple copies of the `fleet` folder causing confusion (Trash, Downloads,
Desktop all having their own)**
`python3 doctor.py`'s second section lists every folder under your home
directory containing both `satellites.yaml` and `run_passes.py`, with each
one's last-modified time, so you can see at a glance which is real and
which are stale duplicates worth deleting.

**`TypeError` or YAML parse errors when running `run_passes.py` or
`plan_passes.py`**
Almost always a stray value in `satellites.yaml` - a quoted number
(`freq_hz: "436160000"`), a typo (`freq_hz: 436160=3000`), or similar.
`preflight.py` validates every field's type explicitly and will name the
exact satellite and field at fault rather than you hunting through a
traceback.

**Not sure if something is a real problem at all**
Start with `python3 doctor.py` every time - it's a strict superset of
`preflight.py` and was specifically built to catch the "environment"
class of problems (wrong folder, stale process, occupied port) that
config-only checks can't see.

## Known caveats

- **Single SDR**: only one flowgraph runs at a time (highest elevation
  wins among approved, in-window passes; a running satellite is not
  pre-empted). Extending to multiple SDRs means tracking more than one
  `(rig, active_proc)` pair in `run_passes.py`.
- **rigctld's Dummy backend response format**: the poller inside each
  `.grc` expects `f\n` to return a bare number - confirmed working, but
  worth re-checking if you ever change Hamlib versions.
- **Doppler sign/magnitude**: sanity-check `doppler_hz()` in
  `run_passes.py` against a known pass before trusting a real recording.
- **Rotor update throttling**: `Rotctld.point()` only sends a new
  position when az or el has moved `>= 5.0` degrees, or `>= 5.0` seconds
  have passed since the last command actually sent (whichever comes
  first) - tuned to cut down command spam during a fast overhead pass
  without ever going silent for long. Both are keyword defaults
  (`min_move_deg`, `min_interval_s`) on `point()` if your rotor's actual
  slew rate ever calls for different values.
- Hand-authored `.grc` blocks (`epy_block`s, `network_socket_pdu`) were
  written outside GNU Radio Companion - open each block's properties
  dialog once after import to let GRC regenerate anything it flags.
- **`SatsDecoder` version**: use the `nightly` tag or later (commit
  `d94ff8e`+). Anything at or before release `0.3.6` has the mid-pass
  false-disconnect bug described in Troubleshooting.
- **`kiss_encode_pdu` is required on every decode-and-relay satellite's
  `.grc`**: `satellites_satellite_decoder`'s PDU output is unframed;
  `network_socket_pdu` has no KISS awareness of its own. Without
  `kiss_encode_pdu` between them, frames reach SatsDecoder unframed and
  get silently dropped or misparsed. See "Why every `.grc` needs a
  `kiss_encode_pdu` block" above. Check this first on any newly-added
  decode-and-relay satellite's `.grc`, since it's easy to copy the
  decoder wiring but forget this one extra hop. Doesn't apply to
  recording-only satellites - they have no `network_socket_pdu` at all.
